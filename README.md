# Library Management Project (PHP)

## Project Purpose
This project simulates a simple library system using PHP data structures and algorithms. It demonstrates three core programming concepts:

1. **Recursive Directory Display**  
   - Uses nested arrays to represent book categories.
   - Recursively traverses and displays categories and books.

2. **Hash Table for Book Details**  
   - Stores book information (author, year, genre) using associative arrays.
   - Allows looking up details for a specific book.

3. **Binary Search Tree (BST) for Book Titles**  
   - Stores book titles alphabetically.
   - Supports quick searching and alphabetical listing of books.

The final **Integration Challenge** combines all three parts into one interactive PHP script.

## How to Run
1. **Display Library**: Run the script to see categories and books recursively.
2. **View Book Details**: Click a book (or provide its name) to see author, year, and genre.
3. **Search Alphabetically**: Use the BST to find a book or list all titles alphabetically.
